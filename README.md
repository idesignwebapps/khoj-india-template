Khoj is a major project initiative for M.A Web Design and Content Planning, University of Greenwich - London.

The website is designed to unlock the mysteries of India and unveil its hidden gems. My website is dedicated to guiding curious souls on a journey beyond the typical tourist trails, as I believe that the true essence of India lies in its lesser-known marvels waiting to be explored.

"Khoj" is a Hindi word that means "search" or "discovery" in English. It can also refer to a quest or exploration for knowledge or truth. As a seasoned traveler and an ardent explorer, I have set out to share India's best-kept secrets, from tucked-away destinations to extraordinary cultural experiences, and everything in between. My goal is to inspire a deeper connection to this remarkable country and its diverse heritage.
